prototype for black desert loot tracker

1. faster clear will need recording with more fps that lead to performance issue due to OCR taking tons of resource usage
2. implementing Bitmap/Template matching than using OCR can work but still need alot of effort and will reduce huge resource usage.

Tested fine for normal grinding with : 7800x3D RTX4060ti 10fps
